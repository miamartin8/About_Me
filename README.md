## About Me

My passions include data science, health, food and sustainability.  I spent four years as a volunteer EMT and ambulance driver, which ignited my interest in health and wellness.  I was a board member of the Atlanta Mobile Market where I educated communities in Atlanta that were designated as food deserts on healthy and sustainable eating.  I am inspired by the companies that are leveraging data science to increase efficiency and sustainability in health and food industries.  

I am a determined problem solver and creative thinker. I am uniquely positioned to combine data science expertise, financial planning and analysis background, and management experience to drive value.  I have 5+ years of experience partnering with senior leadership at Ogilvy to advise on financial performance and provide recommendations on investment decisions.  I created models that relied heavily on the use of historical financial data and future performance indicators to forecast future revenue and profitability.  I developed data visualizations in Excel and Tableau that clearly communicated my data analysis to both technical and non-technical audiences.  

I enrolled at the Data Science Immersive Bootcamp at General Assembly to further my career in data.  At the end of May 2019, I graduated from the 480+ hour immersive course in python programming and data science techniques including wrangling, cleaning and visualizing data, statistical methods, machine learning algorithms for regression and classification, neural networks, and webscraping.  

I built a recommender system that recommends healthier grocery items to purchase.  The tool utilizes FDA nutrition data to calculate a nutrient density score for grocery items, and allows the user to chose between the grocery item they have selected or a list of similar items with higher nutrient density.  I implemented natural language processing and unsupervised learning techniques to create clusters of similar items that are used in the recommender system.  This project combines my love for data science with my passion for health.  Please see my repository "Fooder_Healthier_Groceries" to review my project.  The video of my project presentation is available upon request.

I am searching for a full time data scientist position in the greater Denver, Boston and Philadelphia areas.  Please review my resume included in this repository for more detail on my qualifications.  I am available at your convenience to discuss all data science opportunities.
